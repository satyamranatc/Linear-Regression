Here’s a **clean, detailed, beginner-friendly `README.md`** template for your **Linear Regression practice using scikit-learn** project. I kept it simple, well-formatted, and explanatory, perfect for GitHub:

# 📊 Linear Regression Practice with Scikit-Learn (Python)

Welcome to my **Linear Regression practice project**!  
Here, I’m learning and experimenting with **Linear Regression**, one of the simplest and most popular algorithms in **Machine Learning**.  

This repository contains basic and practical implementations using **Python** and **scikit-learn** to help me understand how Linear Regression works and how to apply it to real-world datasets.

---

## 🚀 What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used to predict a value (target) based on the relationship between variables.  

It tries to fit a straight line (in simple cases) through the data points that best describes the relationship between **input (X)** and **output (Y)**.

### 🔹 Example:
Predicting someone's **salary** based on **years of experience**.  
Or predicting **house prices** based on **size of the house**.

---

## 📌 Types of Linear Regression:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Simple Linear Regression** | Predict using **1 independent variable**. Example: Salary vs. Experience. |
| **Multiple Linear Regression** | Predict using **2 or more independent variables**. Example: House price vs. size + location + age. |

---

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

The basic formula of Linear Regression is:
```
Y = mX + c
```
Where:
- `Y` = Target / Prediction
- `X` = Input Feature
- `m` = Slope (How much Y changes when X increases)
- `c` = Intercept (Value of Y when X = 0)

The goal is to find the best values for **m** and **c** so that the line fits the data as accurately as possible.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas (for data handling)
- NumPy (for mathematical operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting)
- Scikit-Learn (for building the model)

---

## 🔄 Workflow:
1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load Dataset**
3. **Explore and Visualize Data**
4. **Split Data** into Train and Test sets
5. **Train the Linear Regression Model**
6. **Predict on Test Data**
7. **Evaluate the Model** (using metrics like R² Score, Mean Squared Error)
8. **Visualize Results**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **R² Score** | Tells how well the model explains the variation in data (Closer to 1 = better). |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | Average squared difference between actual and predicted values (Lower is better). |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values. |
